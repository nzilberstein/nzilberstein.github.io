My research develops algorithms to solve inverse problems, currently focused on image inverse problems. In particular, I have worked on designing fast and scalable algorithms that incorporate diffusion models as prior distributions. Also, I have worked on graphon estimation using implicit neural representations, zero-shot stitching, and algorithm unfolding and its application to Particle filters.</p> </body></html>
