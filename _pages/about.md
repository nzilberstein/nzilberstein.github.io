I am fourth year Ph.D. student at the ECE department at Rice University, advised by Santiago Segarra. My research develops algorithms to solve inverse problems, currently focused on image inverse problems. In particular, I have worked on designing fast and scalable algorithms that incorporate diffusion models as prior distributions. Also, I have worked on graphon estimation using implicit neural representations, zero-shot stitching, and algorithm unfolding and its application to Particle filters.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
